### This is My Personal Website.

It is node based.

(Note to self, remember how to create node sites by the following commands)

### Install

* __nodemon__ to automatically restart your server
* __express-generator__ to create a bare-bones application

Install both globally:

* <code>npm install -g nodemon</code>
* <code>npm install -g express-generator</code>

Navigate to source folder
Generate scaffolding. Remember to use the <code>--hbs</code> flag to tell the generator that we'll be using handlebars:

* <code>express --view=hbs</code>
